/!\ I do not own the material on this repository. It was used to build the MyBinder version of the January edition of the masterclass Math+Econ+Code, taught by Alfred Galichon.

The original content of the lectures can be found here: https://github.com/math-econ-code/mec_optim

If you want to try out the lectures for yourself, without installing anything, you can simply execute the lectures by checking this link: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AntoineChapel/mecoptim_mybinder/HEAD
